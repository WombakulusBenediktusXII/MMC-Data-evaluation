v0.4-beta, 06.12.2021
    Added:
		- Program can now do multiprocess
        - New config options:
			- [MAIN]: multi_processing, max_processes, save_formatter
			- [GRAPH]: do_graph, save_graph
		- New modul data_output for the saving of the calculated data
			- data_storer, save_to_file, output_array, data_array_test,
			  data_array_first, data_array_add, str_edit
		- processing.main as a new entry point in the evaluation
		- subprocessing.inputtest to check user input.
		- subprocessing.filename_sortingkey for sorting the specified data to
		  ensure fast processing during multiprocessing.
			
    Misc:
        - do_output config now called save_output
		- Optimization of the program
		- Adaptation the PEP8 is complied with
		- Better error messages
		- Updating of config_read_me.txt
		- The measurement series are now synchronized for the output
		- For some options 'auto' can be selected now, then the program decides
		  itself


v0.3-alpha, 29.09.2021
    Added:
        - module config_parser to read the config file in
			- get_config, _main_config, _acc_config, _gyr_config, _graph_config,
			  _int_config, _float_config, _array_config, _list_config,
			  _bool_config, _str_config, _test_list
        - config.ini config file see doc.txt for documentation

    Mics:
        - config_read_me.txt for the documentation of the config.ini


v0.2-alpha, 03.09.2021
    Added:
        - .csv output for the calculated energies
            - Output in this format: f'{energy}_{date}_id-{ID}.csv'
        - Calculation of the total rotaion and translation energies for several
		  measurement series
        - main.var where all user-defined variables are included
        - processing.accgyr For translation with rotation when the sensor is not
		  positioned in the center
        - subprocessing.read to read in .csv files
        - subprocessing.sumforline to get number of lines in a .csv file
        - subprocessing.str_gen to create it iteration string
        - subprocessing.graph2d to create the 2d energy graphs
        - subprocessing.graph3d to create the 3d trajectory graphs
        - subprocessing.synchronize to to synchronize two measurement series
        - conversions.vecrot to rotate a vector
        - conversions.string to manipulate strings
        - conversions.intaxis to interpolate an axis
        - conversions.xyz to compute the trajectory
        - conversions._ktest
        - docstring to all functions

    Removed:
        - conversions.xyz_conv no longer needed, was needed in pre alpha

    Bugs:
        - When outputting files, it has not been checked whether these
		  measurements have been performed at all. This could lead to
		  crashes. This test is now in place.

    Misc:
        - Diagrams with new y-axis format: 1.2f
        - Each diagram is now its own object
        - conversion.time now called conversion.timestep
