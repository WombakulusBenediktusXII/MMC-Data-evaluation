v0.2-alpha
    Added:
        - .csv output for the calculated energies
            - Output in this format: f'{energy}_{date}_id-{ID}.csv'
        - Calculation of the total rotaion and translation energies for several measurement series
        - main.var() where all user-defined variables are included
        - processing.accgyr() For translation with rotation when the sensor is not positioned in the center
        - subprocessing.read() to read in .csv files
        - subprocessing.sumforline() to get number of lines in a .csv file
        - subprocessing.str_gen() to create it iteration string
        - subprocessing.graph2d() to create the 2d energy graphs
        - subprocessing.graph3d() to create the 3d trajectory graphs
        - subprocessing.synchronize() to to synchronize two measurement series
        - conversions.vecrot() To rotate a vector
        - conversions.string() to manipulate strings
        - conversions.intaxis() to interpolate an axis
        - conversions.xyz() to compute the trajectory
        - conversions._ktest()
        - docstring to all functions

    Removed:
        - conversions.xyz_conv() no longer needed, was needed in pre alpha

    Bugs:
        - When outputting files, it has not been checked whether these measurements have
          been performed at all. This could lead to crashes. This test is now in place.

    Misc:
        - Diagrams with new y-axis format: 1.2f
        - Each diagram is now its own object
        - conversion.time() now called conversion.timestep()
